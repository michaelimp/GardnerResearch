#E[Response time] 1 = 1/ (ùúá - lamda / k servers) 

#if the job arrives, the clock jumps to arrival time, I need to create next arrival time. If the queue is empty, I need to also create a departure time
#if a job departs, I need to create a new departure time for the next job to be finished 

#Two distinct approaches:
    # 1. Every time we loop back up in the while loop, we go to the next time that a job arrives, and selects a server. Then we go into this server and react accordingly.
    # It might be the case that we had jobs in this server which should have been completed earlier, so we need to retroactively handle that. Every server has its own nextDepartureTime.
    # 2. Alternatively, we take it one small step at a time. Each server has its own nextArrivalTime and nextDepartureTime. We look across all of this and find the smallest.
    # We react accordingly. The issue with this is that we would have to always loop through each arrivalTime and departureTime, which is slow, unless we can have a list of al lthe next actions and sort it.
